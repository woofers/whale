# Whale

**Dodge eels and lobsters as they attempt to ruin your day in the sea.**

*Whale* is a 2D game I built in 9<sup>th</sup> grade that went unfinished.  Finally found the motivation to finish the score keeping and level generation.

Built using [HaxeFlixel](http://haxeflixel.com/). In-game font is [Little Lord Fontleroy NF](http://www.1001fonts.com/littlelordfontleroy-font.html) by [Nick Curtis](https://www.1001fonts.com/users/nicksfonts/).
