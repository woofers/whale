* Whale
*Dodge eels and lobsters as they attempt to ruin your day in the sea.*

/Whale/ is a 2D game I built in 9^th grade that went unfinished.  Finally found the motivation to finish the score keeping and level generation.

Built using [[http://haxeflixel.com/][HaxeFlixel]]. In-game font is [[http://www.1001fonts.com/littlelordfontleroy-font.html][Little Lord Fontleroy NF]] by [[https://www.1001fonts.com/users/nicksfonts/][Nick Curtis]].
